# Lyrics to "Across The Universe"

## From Nothing's Gonna Change Our World


Let me take you down,
cuz I'm going to
Strawberry Fields.

(Chord Chord Chord)

*Jai guru deva, om*  

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
for(chorus in 1:4){
print(paste(

  chorus,"Let It Be"))
}
```

Images of broken light which move before me like a million eyes  
They call me on and on across the universe  
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox they  
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe  
*Jai guru deva, om*  

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
for(chorus in 1:4){
print(paste(
  chorus,"Nothing's gonna change my world"))
}
```

Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing  
Through my open ears inciting and inviting me  
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns  
It calls me on and on across the universe  
*Jai guru deva, om*  

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
for(chorus in 1:4){
print(paste(
  chorus,"Nothing's gonna change my world"))
}
```



```{r}
#| code-fold: true

for(chorus in 1:6){
print(paste(chorus,"Jai guru deva"))
}
```
