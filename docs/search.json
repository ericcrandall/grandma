    "text": "Cooking time: It’s complicated\nNow, the big trick to getting grandma’s glop just right is cooking it for the proper length of time. Describing this is going to require that we cite some literature and also that we write down some equations…What fun! Let’s see how we do that with R Markdown. Cooking time \\(M\\) (for minutes) decreases as the square root of the cooking temperature \\(T\\), but increases as the \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\)-power of the elevation \\(a\\) (for altitude), in feet. For \\(300^\\circ \\leq T \\leq 500^\\circ\\) and \\(0\\leq a \\leq 5000\\), cooking time is \\[\nM = (20 - \\sqrt{T/4}) \\times \\biggl(\\frac{a+5000}{2500}\\biggr)^\\frac{3}{2}\n\\] Anyone that is really interested in writing technical mathematical documents should learn to use LaTeX directly. Thankfully, you can imbed R code within LaTeX much as can be done with R Markdown.\nWe should perhaps qualify this model with a few statements. This model was not empirically derived by rigorous tests, rather we guessed at it given similar work done on cooking times of Cassiopea jellies at altitude (Sharp et al. 2022) and for Orbicella with different microbiomes (Boville et al. 2023). But please bear in mind that we did not account for the issues noted by Gonzalez-Pech et al. (2021) which arise while using next generation oven technology. You can easily add citations by clicking “Addins” and “Insert Citations”\nClearly, it would be nice to have a table of cooking times, \\(M\\), for a few values of \\(T\\) and \\(a\\). Let’s take \\(T\\in\\{300, 350, 400, 450, 500\\}\\) and \\(a\\in\\{0, 1250, 2500, 3750, 5000\\}\\). Holy smokes! There will be 25 rows in that table! I don’t want to write that by hand!\nThankfully, we can use R to do it for us. We make a a data frame of values, then use a nifty function kable from the knitr package to make the table. Get ready, we are going to use some R:\n\n# first make the data frame\ntemps <- rep(seq(300,500,50), 5)\nalts <- rep(seq(0, 5000, 1250), each=5)\ntab <- tibble(T = temps, a = alts, M = (20-sqrt(temps/4)) * ((alts+5000)/2500) ^ (3/2))\n\nAnd then we print it and it looks like this. (Check out how I hid that code block)\n\n\n\n\n\nT\na\nM\n\n\n\n\n300\n0\n32.07365\n\n\n350\n0\n30.11103\n\n\n400\n0\n28.28427\n\n\n450\n0\n26.56854\n\n\n500\n0\n24.94577\n\n\n300\n1250\n44.82428\n\n\n350\n1250\n42.08144\n\n\n400\n1250\n39.52847\n\n\n450\n1250\n37.13067\n\n\n500\n1250\n34.86277\n\n\n300\n2500\n58.92305\n\n\n350\n2500\n55.31749\n\n\n400\n2500\n51.96152\n\n\n450\n2500\n48.80953\n\n\n500\n2500\n45.82830\n\n\n300\n3750\n74.25153\n\n\n350\n3750\n69.70801\n\n\n400\n3750\n65.47900\n\n\n450\n3750\n61.50704\n\n\n500\n3750\n57.75026\n\n\n300\n5000\n90.71797\n\n\n350\n5000\n85.16685\n\n\n400\n5000\n80.00000\n\n\n450\n5000\n75.14719\n\n\n500\n5000\n70.55728\n\n\n\n\n\nCooking times, \\(M\\), at various temperatures, \\(T\\), and elevations, \\(a\\)."
